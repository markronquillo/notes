# Configuring Full-Stack with Node.js Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Falcor and Redux.

- Install NVM, Node and NPM
- Prepare MongoDB in our local environment
- Robomongo for Mongo's GUI
- Express.js setup
- Mongoose installation and configuration
- Initial React Redux structure for our client-side app
- Netflix Falcor on the backend and frontend as a glue and replacement for the old RESTful approach.

#### Falcor basic concepts

Falcor is like a glue between 

- Backend and its database structure 
- Frontend Redux single state tree container

`falcor-express` and `falcor-router`

#### Structure of JWT Token

The header has information that is required on the backend for recognizing what cryptograhic operation to do based on that information

The second part of the token consists of claims provided in JSON format

- Issuer: lets us know who has issued the token
- Audience: lets us know that this token has to be consumed by our application
- Issue data: lets us know when the token has been created
- Expiration date: lets us knoww when the token is expiring so we have to generate a new one
- Subject: this lets us know which part of tha pp can use the token
