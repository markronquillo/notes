# Async Redux Workshop

## Requirements:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
    * NVM is the easiest way to manage Node. [Its setup instructions here](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation). Then run `nvm install node && nvm alias default node`, which installs the latest version of Node.js and sets up your terminal so you can run it by typing `node`. With nvm you can install multiple versions of Node.js and easily switch between them.
    * New to [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/)?

## Instructions:

`cd` into this project and install all the dependencies with `npm install`. Once
that's finished, type `npm start` and you should see the project in your browser
at `localhost:3000`.
