## Agenda

Parallel vs Async:
Callbacks
Thunks
Promises
Generators/Coroutines
Event Reactive (observables)
CSP - channel-oriented concurrency

Understand Promises and Generators 

## Parallel vs Async

Parallel is not the same with Async.

Parallelism uses multiple thread to accomplish, well, parallelism.

Asynchronous only runs on a single thread.

## Concurrency

Two higher level task occurs at the same time. What is a high level task or a macro level task?

The total time it took to finish the two macro tasks may be the same but in the user's perspective it is happening at the same time.

Context Switching!  

Asynchronous Programming is managing the concurrency.
