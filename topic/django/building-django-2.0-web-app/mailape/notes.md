# MailApe

`path()` This takes a string and either a view or the result of include(). Django will iterate over the path()s in a URLConf until itfinds one that matches the path of a request to that view or URLConf, If it's a URLConf, then that list of path()s is checked.

`include()`: This takes a URLConf and a namespace name. A namespace isolates a URLConf from each other so that we can prevent name collisions.
