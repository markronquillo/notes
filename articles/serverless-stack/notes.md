## Set up your AWS Account

#### Create an IAM User

Amazon IAM enables you to manage users and user permissions in AWS.

1. Go to AWS Console.
2. Go to Users Tab
3. Click Add User
	3.1 Enter username
	3.2 Check programmatic access
4. Attach Existing policies directly
5. Search for AdministrationAccess and select the policy
6. Create user
7. Take note of secret access key

#### What is IAM

An IAM policy is a rule or set of rules defining the operatiosn allowed/denied to be performed on an AWS resource.

Policies can be granted in a number of ways:

- Attaching a managed policy. AWS provides a list of pre-defined policies such as AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess.
- Attaching an inline policy. An inline policy is a custom policy created by hand.
- Adding the user to a group that has appropriate permission policies attached. Weâ€™ll look at groups in detail below.
- Cloning the permission of an existing IAM user.

Here is a policy that grants all operatiosn to all S3 buckets.
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "s3:*",
    "Resource": "*"
  }
}
```

Here is a policy that grants more granular access, only allowing retrieval of files prefixed by the string Bobs- in the bucket called Hello-bucket.
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": ["s3:GetObject"],
    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::Hello-bucket/*",
    "Condition": {"StringEquals": {"s3:prefix": "Bobs-"}}
}
```

#### What is an IAM Role

an identity with permission policies that determine what thte identity can/cannot do in AWS.


#### What is an IAM Group

An IAM group is simply a collection of IAM users.


#### What is ARN

Amazon Resource Names uniquely identify AWS resources. We require an ARN when you need to specify a resource unambiguosly across all AWS, such as in IAM policies, RDS tags and API calls.

ARN is just a globally unique identifier for an individual AWS resource and be in the ff format:

```
arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource
arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resourcetype/resource
arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resourcetype:resource
```

Common use cases for ARN:

1. Communication

ARN is used to reference a specific resource when you orchestrate a system involving multiple AWS resources. 

2. IAM Policy

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": ["s3:GetObject"],
    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::Hello-bucket/*"
}
```


#### Configure the AWS CLI

`aws configure` enter your user key and secret


## Setting up the Backend


#### Create a DynamoDB Table

We are using DynamoDB to store our notes data for our app.

Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability.

`http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.CoreComponents.html`

1. Go to DynamoDB
2. Create Table
	2.1 Table name `notes`
	2.2 Primary Key - `userId`
	2.3 Sort Key - `noteId`
	2.4 Ensure `Use default settings`


#### Create an S3 bucket for file uploads.

We need a place to store our file uploads and this will be S3.

1. Go to S3.
2. Create a bucket
3. Enter name 
4. Enter region

Enable CORS by

In the notes app we'll be building, users will be uplaoding files to the bucket we just created. S3 does not allow its resources to be accessed from a different domain. We can fix this by enabling CORS for our S3 bucket.

```xml
<CORSConfiguration>
	<CORSRule>
		<AllowedOrigin>*</AllowedOrigin>
		<AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
		<AllowedMethod>PUT</AllowedMethod>
		<AllowedMethod>POST</AllowedMethod>
		<AllowedMethod>HEAD</AllowedMethod>
		<MaxAgeSeconds>3000</MaxAgeSeconds>
		<AllowedHeader>*</AllowedHeader>
	</CORSRule>
</CORSConfiguration>
```

Paste the configuration above in created s3 bucket -> permissions -> CORS configuration.

#### Create a Cognito User Pool

Our notes app needs to handle user accounts and authentication in a secure and reliable way. To do this we are going to use Amazon Cognito.

1. Create User Pool
2. Enter notes-user-pool -> Review defaults
3. Create pool
4. Go to Apps Tab
	4.1 Add App
	4.2 Enter App name
	4.3 Unselect `Generate client secret`
	4.4 Select Enable sign-in API for server-based authentication
	4.5 finally Create app.

#### Create a Cognito Test User

We will use AWS CLi to interact with Cognito.


Create User
```
 aws cognito-idp sign-up \
  --region us-east-1 \
  --client-id YOUR_COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID \
  --username admin@example.com \
  --password Passw0rd! \
  --user-attributes Name=email,Value=admin@example.com
```

Verify a User
```
aws cognito-idp admin-confirm-sign-up \
 --region us-east-1 \
 --user-pool-id YOUR_USER_POOL_ID \
 --username admin@example.com
```

#### Create a Cognito Identity Pool

Now that we have our Cognito User Pool setup to handle authentication, we can use that to secure other AWS resources. 

Amazon Cognito Federated Identities enables develoeprs to create unique identities for your users and authenticate them with federated identity providers. With a federated identity, you can obtain temporary, limited-privilege AWS credentials to securely access other AWS services such as Amazon DynamoDB AmazonS2 and Amazon API Gateway.

1. Go to Cognito
2. Manage Federated Identities
3. Select Authentication providers:
	3.1. Under Cognito tab, Enter User Pool ID
	3.2. Enter App Client ID
	3.3. Create Pool


```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "mobileanalytics:PutEvents",
        "cognito-sync:*",
        "cognito-identity:*"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:*"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::markronquillo-notes-app/${cognito-identity.amazonaws.com:sub}*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Set up the Serverless Framework
